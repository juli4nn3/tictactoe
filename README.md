# tictactoe
tic tac toe program bc it's summer break :)

 -- idea:
    9 buttons / on click, turns to "X" if clicked again, turns to "O", if clicked again, resets to blank
    if 3 in a row are the same, screen flashes to "WINNER" ?? and we victory royale like YIPPPEEE!!
    does that sound good?
    okies :3
